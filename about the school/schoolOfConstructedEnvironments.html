	<h4>The School of Constructed Environments challenges students to grapple with the forces shaping the world today: shifts in global and local ecological flows, changes in living patterns, growing economic disparities, excessive consumption, and increasing ethnic diversity. Interior, lighting, product design, and architecture students work with faculty and citizens of global communities to learn the skills of design engagement, integrated thinking, and urban practice in a collective effort to transform our cities into sustainable urban habitats, products, interiors, and buildings.</h4>
<h2>A COMMUNITY OF LEARNING</h2>
<p>The Parsons Table, produced in the interior design department in the 1930s, was a radical design that reflected the egalitarian and progressive ideals associated with Parsons. Today the School of Constructed Environments (SCE) uses the table to represent itself as a gathering place and a platform for forward-looking interdisciplinary scholarship. </p>
<h2>A WEALTH OF RESOURCES</h2>
<p>The school encourages students to take advantage of all of the resources at Parsons and the rest of The New School, to interact with others working in SCE's 13,000-square-foot studio, and to work together in the on-site <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/subpage.aspx?id=38399">facilities</a> that include fabrication shops, computing labs, the ceramics studio, the<a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/subpage.aspx?id=38399#LightLab"> Light Lab</a>, and <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/subpage.aspx?id=38399#Donghia">the Angelo Donghia Materials Center</a>.</p>
<h2>MULTIDISCIPLINARY STUDY</h2>
<p>The school's 200 dedicated faculty believe socially aware innovation is created  beyond disciplinary boundaries. Every SCE program exposes students to the cultural, environmental, and technological forces that are transforming human habitats so that they can design a more intelligent, sustainable world.</p>
