                <h3>A LEGACY OF PROGRESSIVE INNOVATION</h3>
                <P>A pioneer in art and design education since its founding in 1896, Parsons has cultivated outstanding artists, designers, scholars, businesspeople, and community leaders for more than a century. Today, when design thinking is increasingly being employed to solve complex global problems, Parsons is leading new approaches to art and design education.
                </P>
                <P>At Parsons, a diverse community of students develops critical thinking skills and applies them to challenges ranging from environmental degradation to physical accessibility and humanitarian crises. Through a network of interconnected design laboratories, students explore global phenomena at multiple sites and scales of engagement, from on-campus research initiatives to partnerships that affect change in New York and around the world.  Each undergraduate, associate, and graduate degree program at Parsons is housed in one of five schools. This organizational structure supports Parsons’ educational mission, and its interdisciplinary approach builds community among students and faculty in related disciplines.</P>
                <img src="images/parsonsTheNewSchoolForDesign.png">
                <P>arsons also offers open enrollment courses for nondegree students of all ages, in which you can build a portfolio or take art and design courses for credit or on a noncredit basis. 
                </P>
                <h3>PARSONS IN THE NEW SCHOOL</h3>
                <p>he New School holds a respected place among forward-thinking American Universities, attracting adventurous, creative, civic-minded scholars. A Parsons education combines the creative focus of an independent art and design school with the resources of The New School, a recognized liberal arts university. Both institutions have long been advocates of progressive thought and action, taking on urgent challenges facing society and preparing students to work in new and existing fields. Students complement their design and art education with courses in anthropology, public policy, business, media studies, the performing arts, and other disciplines, developing the capacity to work collaboratively across a range of projects and settings. </p>
                <P>The New School is made up of seven divisions that offer undergraduate, associate, and graduate degrees and certificates in a number of disciplines. </P>

            <h1>MESSAGE FROM THE DEAN</h1>
            <div class="scroll">
                <img src="images/dean.png">
                <p>Human imagination and endeavor are constantly remaking the world.  As a species, we prod, bend, and transform the raw materials and energy flows of the planet into the objects, spaces, and places of everyday life.  We are makers of cities, homes, buildings, and parks, cars, trains, planes, and bicycles.  We develop technologies, tools, and networks that allow us to communicate across great distances and extend the capacity of our bodies to sense and comprehend the world around us.  We are storytellers and explorers, by turns restless, rooted, innovative, cautious, atnd wildly creative.  We define beauty, proportion, and aesthetics in ways that bring us together and drive us apart. Human beings are artists and designers capable of the most compassionate, farsighted, and joyful actions and of doing great harm. Design is not a neutral act. </p>
                <p>Design enables human action.  It is purposeful and magnifies capacity.  It reveals and conceals who we are.  And while design has played a role in every epoch of human history, it has never been more important than now.  Today, communities around the world are confronted with new material, strategic, and interconnected challenges: food systems,fresh water resources, poverty, healthcare, energy efficiency, transportation infrastructure, and humanitarian aid, to mention just a few.  Design alone will not solve these challenges but neither will they be adequately engaged without the creativity and strategic thinking of designers. We live in a designed world.</p>
                <p>Design is emergent. In many critical ways, public awareness of design has never been greater.  Design thinking is becoming highly regarded among business leaders and policymakers and it is increasingly understood as adding significant value because it frames problems and envisions solutions from a different perspective.  As design evolves, it is as often concerned with conceiving and arranging complex systems as it is with creating beautiful and useful objects.  Design is a generative and a regenerative endeavor with immediate impact and long-term implications. And the challenges of our time require more than ever that artists and designers focus their talents not simply on how things appear but on how things fundamentally are and, more to the point, how they could be. Here, a critical link between design, social science, and policy emerges, representing part of what distinguishes Parsons as a place to learn.</p>
                <p>Parsons is organized into five schools—Art, Media, and Technology; Fashion; Constructed Environments; Art and Design History and Theory; and Design Strategies. This structure facilitates specialization in a given field while enabling interdisciplinary and cross-school scholarship that affords designers the broad design perspective they need in today’s professional world. Additionally, Parsons’ students benefit greatly from our integration within a research and liberal arts university, The New School.  Our students can complement their design education with first-rate courses in anthropology, political science, public policy, music and drama, and many other disciplines, acquiring the capacity to work collaboratively across a wide range of projects and contexts.</p>
                <p>The faculty and students at Parsons build critically engaged art and design practices.  Whether they’re studying fine arts, fashion or photography, architecture, product or lighting design, illustration, interior or urban design, communication design or technology, integrated or transdisciplinary design, the design of business, the business of design, the core questions of the environment and sustainability or design itself, Parsons students and faculty continuously seek to advance art and design and renew their relevance in the world.</p>
                <p>I strongly believe that it is an ideal time to study art and design and that Parsons provides a unique and deeply relevant context in which to do it.  I hope you will join the talented, energetic, and creative students and faculty at Parsons.  The future is always being designed.  Come be part of it.</p>

                <h3>First Year</h3>
                <p>Parsons' first-year course of study* immerses you in an exploration of art and design concepts, skills, and critical practices, training you to become flexible thinkers, strong makers, and lifelong learners. 
                The curriculum offers a survey of approaches to art and design that prepare you for the undergraduate majors at Parsons and enable you to envision paths beyond the confines of a single discipline. </p>
                <p>First year is a common experience for all incoming Parsons students, with the same set of course requirements for students in all BFA programs. You will be able to shape their path of study within those requirements, selecting from the various options available for many of the required courses. BBA students at Parsons follow a similar curriculum, with a few exceptions specific to their programs, and share many courses with BFA students. </p>
                <p>After completing freshman-year coursework, students work with advisors, in consultation with instructors, to define their goals and choose the appropriate degree program.</p>

                <p class="footnote">Students entering Parsons prior to Fall 2013 take their first-year courses through the Foundation program. </p>
                <h3>GROUNDING IN LIBERAL ARTS</h3>
                <P>All undergraduate programs include a strong liberal arts component, including courses in art and design history and theory, that provide a context for studio practice. And because Parsons is part of The New School, you can choose from a wide range of lecture courses and electives in humanities, social sciences, media studies, and business. Parsons also offers a dual BA/BFA degree in which you can combine a BFA from Parsons with a BA from Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts. </P>
